Hi, I'm Divya Acharya, I currently study BSC_IT. I specialize in web development, with expertise in languages like JavaScript, Python, and HTML.

I have contributed to several open-source projects, including React, Django, Laravel, and Angular. I am always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and build cool things with other developers.

In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with Raspberry Pi projects and participating in hackathons. I'm also a big fan of indie games and have created a few myself.

Feel free to check out my GitHub repositories and get in touch if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project together. Thanks for stopping by!
